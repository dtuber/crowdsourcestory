      <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
        Have you ever played a text adventure or a visual novel and gotten really angry because you couldn't get past that one crossing where going in each direction resulted in nothing happening?

        Have you ever wanted to throw your computer against a wall because of this?

        Have you ever wanted to edit one of these stories because you know you could do it better?

        Good news, so have we.  

        StoryTime is a crowd-sourced storyteller that simultaneously allows you to become both a player and a storyteller.  Are you playing through a story, and you don't like any of the options?  That's cool, just make your own offshoot.  Did you think the ending to a story was really blase?  Awesome, make your own ending that totally rocks.  There's no limit to what you can make, and there's no limit to the diversity of a story.
